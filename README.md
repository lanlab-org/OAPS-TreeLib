# TreeLib

TreeLib is a simple online application that provides open access
publishing service to authors who love to share their ideas and
findings in a non-blocking fashion.  The author could publish an
article as long as he provides a valid email address.  No need to sign
up.

Check this link http://lanlab.org/course/2018f/oo/project_description.pdf for more detail.




# Mission

TreeLib puts authors' needs first and values massive review.



# How to Contribute

We welcome your participation in this project.

Your participation does not have to be in the form of contributing code. You could help us on ideas, suggestions, documentation, etc.

You need to be an invited member of Lan Laboratory before you can push your feature branch or bugfix branch to the central reops at https://github.com/lanlab-org

Send Hui (lanhui at zjnu.edu.cn) an email message including your GitHub account name so that he could invite you to be a member of Lan Laboratory.

As of March 31 2020, there are 30 members in Lan Laboratory (https://github.com/orgs/lanlab-org/people).

You will use the feature-branching workflow (see below) when interacting with the central repo. The main point of this workflow is that you work on a branch on your local drive, push that branch to the central repo, and create a Pull Request (i.e., Pull Me Request) at GitHub for other people to review your changes. When everything is OK, then someone could merge your changes to the master branch in the central repo.

I believe that code review at the Pull Request stage is important for both improving code quality and improving team quality.


## The Feature-branching Workflow

We will use the feature-branching workflow for collaboration. The idea is that you make your own branch, work on it, and push this branch to the central repo for review.

Check the section The feature-branching workflow in the following link for more detail:
